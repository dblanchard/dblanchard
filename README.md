### About

**Thanks for stopping by.** 
I've been establishing and maturing security programs for over 20 years. My goal here is to share some of what I've learned, continue building community, and sharpen my proverbial saw. You can contact me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/practicalciso/.

Some stuff I'm excited about:
- [An Unkindness of Ravens](https://github.com/dblanchard/An-Unkindness-of-Ravens) - Remote, orchestrated pen testing using Raspberry Pis over Tailscale
- [Mentor Minutes](https://github.com/dblanchard/Mentor-Minutes) - Short video interviews with people in (or entering) cybersecurity in which they share wisdom they've gleaned and experiences they've had
